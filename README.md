# Hi, I'm Archie Irving 👋  
### MSc Data Science Student | BSc Psychology (First-Class, 89%)

I specialise in behavioural data, statistical modelling, and applied analytics. My background in psychology and data science allows me to understand human behaviour through a quantitative lens and translate insights into real-world applications.

My undergraduate dissertation — **[Evaluating the Clinical Validity of ADHD Portrayals on TikTok](https://github.com/ArchieIrving/undergraduate-dissertation/)** — developed strong skills in quantitative analysis, behavioural data coding, and applying statistical models to real-world problems.

## 🔍 What I’m Passionate About

I work at the intersection of **behavioural science, statistical modelling, and business insight**, with a focus on understanding *why* people behave the way they do and how data can meaningfully explain or predict those behaviours.

I'm particularly interested in:
- **Statistical & predictive modelling**
- **Behavioural and psychological datasets**
- **Research design and methodology**
- **Big data & scalable analytics**
- **Business-focused data science**

Outside academia, I run my own clothing brand, which has given me hands-on experience with:
- **Marketing strategy & customer behaviour analytics**
- **Data-driven decision-making** (SEO, sales analytics, retention metrics)
- **Brand building & operations**

Combining **psychology**, **business**, and **data science** allows me to approach problems holistically: understanding users, modelling their behaviour, and translating insights into real-world impact.


## 🛠 Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python, R, SQL, Java  
**Tools & Environments:** Git, GitHub, VS Code  
**Data Skills:** Statistical analysis, predictive modelling, data visualisation, behavioural data analysis  
**Currently learning:** Business analysis (optional module), big data techniques, and advanced ML workflows


## 📘 Current & Upcoming Projects

Current work includes:

- **Socioeconomic Classification Analysis** — Using chi-square tests and logistic regression to understand misclassification of socioeconomic class.
- **AI Policy Evaluation** — Analysing AI governance principles and their societal impact.
- **Music Modelling Challenge** — Predicting song success and clustering musical styles using open audio feature datasets.
- **R Visualisation Project** — Building a composite visualisation (4+ charts) with documented R code, theory, and accessibility considerations.

## 🚀 Fun Fact

I started programming as a young teenager while running a Minecraft server. This led me to join a development team for **ProjectKorra**, where I worked as a **developer and head game designer**. Through this long-term project, I gained experience in:

- Software development & collaborating across time zones  
- Managing a development and design team  
- Planning updates, features, and gameplay systems  
- Working with SQL/MySQL databases  
- Designing economies, progression systems, and balancing mechanics  
- Running a profitable server with a growing community  
- Website creation, SEO, analytics, and e-commerce  
- Marketing, customer satisfaction, and community reputation management  

Over 10+ years, this experience shaped my interest in **marketing psychology, user behaviour, system design, and modelling** — ultimately leading me toward data science.
